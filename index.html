            <h1>CSS: NESTING</h1>
            <p>Nesting allows you to place one style rule inside another, enabling the inner rule to use, or inherit,
                the same elements as the outer rule. This simplifies the process of grouping similar styles together in
                your CSS file, making it easier to read and manage your code.</p>
            <p>CSS nesting using the ‘&’ syntax is typically associated with preprocessors like Sass and SCSS. It allows
                you to create more organized and maintainable CSS code by specifying styles for nested elements without
                repeating the parent selector.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
                        <p>While nesting is a helpful feature, over-nesting can result in overly specific selectors and
                            a more complex CSS output. It's important to use nesting judiciously to maintain a clean and
                            efficient codebase.</p>

                        <ul class="white">
                            <li>
                                <p>Readability: Nesting makes your code more structured and easier to follow since it
                                    visually represents the element hierarchy.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Maintenance: If you need to change the parent selector, you only need to update it in
                                    one place.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Reduced Repetition: You avoid repeating the parent selector, which can lead to more
                                    concise code.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                        <p>Nesting in CSS using the & syntax in preprocessors is a way to simplify your code and make it
                            more maintainable by referencing the parent selector within nested blocks, reducing
                            repetition, and improving code organization.</p>

            <h1>favorite so far: HOVER Selector</h1>
            <p>I personally don’t have a ton of experience coding in HTML and CSS, so I haven't learned a lot about the
                tools that the languages offer. That being said, I think that one of my favorite features of CSS that I
                have learned so far is the hover selector. </p>
            <p>The main job of CSS is to format a page nicely, and it can start to feel like you are putting a lot of
                work into a static document. However, just by adding hover states to elements of your presentation, you
                can truly bring it to life, reminding viewers of the amazing component of the web: interactivity.</p>

            <!-- I want to add a hover state to this img that changes the gradient of the img, or changes to the variant svg that I made in figma. I got chatgpt to help me make some code to do this-->

            <h1>THE IMPACT OF AI</h1>
            <p>I believe that AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and others are extremely helpful for web designers,
                and positively impact web development. </p>
            <p>ChatGPT can be a great tool for students learning how to code for HTML and CSS. They can feed examples to
                the tool and have it explain to them what is going on, or even take more thorough and complex
                definitions and explanations from reputable resources such as w3.org and re-word them in ways easier to
                understand for individuals who may not yet have the vocabulary to navigate these spaces.</p>
            <p>AI such as Copilot can reduce stress and save time by managing repetitive tasks and providing well
                structured data in no time. This allows developers to solve tasks more creatively, or put more time and
                energy in to higher level tasks. Human involvement remains crucial for creativity, ethical
                considerations, intricate decision-making, and understanding AI-generated outcomes. This ensures that
                websites are both effective and secure, while also aligning with human values and goals. When AI and
                human expertise work together, they can create more advanced, efficient, and user-friendly websites.</p>
